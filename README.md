# hyperv-vm-collector
This project provides a simple and secure Python tool to query multiple Hyper-V servers using WinRM, gathering details such as VM name, state, RAM, CPU count, and IP addresses. It’s ideal for system administrators who need to centralize virtual machine information across different hosts without relying on external management consoles.
